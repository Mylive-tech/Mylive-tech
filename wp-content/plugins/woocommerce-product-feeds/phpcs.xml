	    There is a special internal error message produced by PHP_CodeSniffer
	    when it is unable to detect code in a file, possible due to
	    the use of short open tags even though php.ini disables them.
	    You can disable this message in the same way as sniff messages.

	    Again, the code here will be displayed in the PHP_CodeSniffer
	    output when using the -s command line argument while checking a file.
