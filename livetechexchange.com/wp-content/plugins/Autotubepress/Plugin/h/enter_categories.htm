Enter one category per line.

Each one of the lines here is "synchronized" with the respective line of the "Keywords" area. 

For example, the first keyword you entered will be posted under the first category you entered. The second keyword you entered will be posted under the second category you entered. And so on.

You can include the same category more than once. You would do this if you have more than one keywords that you want posted under the same category.

Any categories you include here that don't already exist, will be created automatically.

If you leave this area completely blank, all videos will be posted under the default category (usually called "Uncategorized", unless you manually rename it).

Double quotes around categories are ignored. This means that Dog Training and "Dog Training" will create ONE category called Dog Training. This way you can just take your keyword list and paste it as a category list as well (to post each keyword under its own category) - without having to worry about some of your keywords having quotes and others not.

Category names are not case sensitive. For example, any of the following 3 keywords:

dog training
Dog Training
dOG TRAininG

... will result in a category called: Dog Training. The first letter of each word of the category will be automatically capitalised.

Category List Example:

lose weight fast
"lose weight fast"
Healthy Weight Loss
low calorie dieting
