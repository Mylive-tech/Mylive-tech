Enter one word per line.

Any videos that include any of the following terms in the video title, description or tags will NOT be added to your blog.

Do NOT include the minus sign (-) before each kewyword. 

You can use single words, as well as multi-word terms within quotes.

If one of these terms is included in a keyword you entered in the first field (the "Keywords" field) then that keyword will get ignored. Make sure you don't go crazy with the negative kewywords. But add some terms to keep out "the bad stuff."

<b>Example:</b>

Let's say that you want to find videos related to windows (vinyl windows, aluminum windows, fiberglass windows etc...) - and AVOID videos that are about "Microsoft Windows."

Negative Keyword List Example:

xp
microsoft
2000
vista

<b>Important Note:</b>

This list is NOT to avoid "bad comments" with keywords like f***, sh**, etc. IF you want to avoid those bad comments from finding their way into your blog, you can use a text editor like Notepad or Textpad to edit the file <a href="/PLUG/h/bad_words.htm" target="blank">bad_words.html</a> <font color="FF0000"><== [Don't click if you get offended easily :-)]</font> It's in the "h" folder that stands for "help files." That file already includes the main "bad words" some people use.
