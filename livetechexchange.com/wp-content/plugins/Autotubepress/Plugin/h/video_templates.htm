Here, you can select if you want to add extra HTML code in your video.

You can add code before the actual video, between the video and the description or after the description (or all of these).

You may want to do this in order to add a call to action like "Click Here to See The Top Product I Recommend", a banner etc.

If you remove the [description] token, the description will not be included below the video.

If you remove the [comments] token, the video comments will not be added as blog post comments.

You can click the "Reset to default" link in order to "clean up" the template and start again.
