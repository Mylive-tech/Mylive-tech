Enter one keyword per line. 

You can enter up to 15 keywords. For example, if you enter 17, the last 2 keywords will be ignored.

5-7 keywords usually works great. It gives enough "LSI variance", without spreading things too thin.

You can include the keyword within double quotes for an "exact match" search. For example, if you enter:

dog training tips

...the plugin will search for videos that  have the word "dog" AND the word "training" AND the word "tips" somewhere in the title, description or tags of the video. 

But, if you enter

"dog training tips"

...the plugin will only show videos that include this EXACT term. This option is <b>highly recommended</b> if you want super-targeted videos on your blog. 

If some of your keywords are "too long-tail" (they contain too many single "words" or aren't searched that often), you may want to NOT include them within quotes, because not many videos may exist for them.

<b>Keyword list example:</b>

lose weight fast
"lose weight fast"
"healthy weight loss"
"low calorie dieting"

AutoTubePress will rotate through keywords in the order you enter them: Let's say that you enter these keywords: 

"keyword 1"
"keyword 2"
"keyword 3"

AutoTubePress will start posting videos with these keywords:

"keyword 1"
"keyword 2"
"keyword 3"
"keyword 1"
"keyword 2"
"keyword 3"
"keyword 1"
"keyword 2"
"keyword 3"
etc...
