If you click the "Delete Posts" button, ALL the posts on your blog will be deleted. 

You may want to do this, if you accidentally entered many wrong keywords - or, if you forgot to add categories and all the videos got posted under "Uncategorized." 

You may also want to use it, if you are still "playing" with the plugin and are experimenting with the different posting options. 

In any case, make sure you DEFINITELY want to delete all the posts on your blog. 

This button will delete ALL blog posts - whether they were created by the plugin, or manually by you - whether they are already "published" or just "scheduled."

This button is best used on a BRAND-NEW blog, with no older posts on it.

If you try to click the "delete posts" button, an "alert" will come up, asking you if you are sure. If you are not sure, you can click "cancel" and nothing will happen.

If you want to delete many posts manually instead, just go to "Posts." You can use the drop-down menus to help you find and filter the scheduled posts faster. You can also use the "Screen Options" tab (top right) to set the number of viewable results to, say, 100.
